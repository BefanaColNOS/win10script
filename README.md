## Modifications
I encourage people to fork this project and comment out things they don't like! Here is a list of normal things people change:
- Uninstalling OneDrive (This is on in my script)
- Installing Adobe, Chocolatey, Notepad++, MPC-HC, and 7-Zip

Comment any thing you don't want out... Example:

```
########## NOTE THE # SIGNS! These disable lines This example shows UACLow being set and Disabling SMB1
### Security Tweaks ###
	"SetUACLow",                  # "SetUACHigh",
	"DisableSMB1",                # "EnableSMB1",

########## NOW LETS SWAP THESE VALUES AND ENABLE SMB1 and Set UAC to HIGH
### Security Tweaks ###
	"SetUACHigh",
	"EnableSMB1",
```
